      <description>Monorepo (all projects are stored in a single repository) is a relatively new concept (to me) and so I&amp;rsquo;ve provided more than usual hits/sample code in the kata. This is primarily to help me cement the core commands.
The BACKGROUND to why I&amp;rsquo;ve created this is kata is this. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently needed to create several RabbitMQ consumers through a devised pattern, including additional common functionality. As there is common code, I did not want to violate the DRY principle so set about researching a way to do this, easily, with a nodejs repo.</description>
